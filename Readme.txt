Javascript-Calculator: An incredibly simplistic calculator and unfortunately the only javascript example I could find from my school projects. I hope this at least shows a base understanding despite it being less expansive than my java projects. The calculator takes a left and right number input as well as an operator in the middle.


Multimedia-App-Code: An application used to display a graphic weather map based on input files. This code is reliant on a .jar file from my multimedia class to opperate as an application provided in multimedia-app. Used to show java proficient as well as application development.


Tile_Game: Another java application. This is ment to run in a vscode terminal to play a game on a 3x3 tile grid.
